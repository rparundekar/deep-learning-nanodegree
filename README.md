# deep-learning-nanodegree
This project is meant for me to upload/commit my solutions to the python assignments for the Udacity Deep Learning Foundations Nanodegree.

## Contents
I'll be commiting my udacity DL submissions here. The following are the assignments I have worked on, the rest being the course code for learning.
1. first-neural-network
2. image-classification
3. tv-script-generation

The rest of the folders contain starter/explanatory code from Udacity and may contain my edits as I learn deep learning.
1. intro-to-rnns
2. intro-to-tensorflow
3. intro-to-tflearn
4. sentiment-rnn
5. sentiment_network
6. tensorboard
7. embeddings
8. weight-initialization

## Usage (Python)
Please use the ```.ipynb``` notebooks (on ```github``` itself) to see the code. 

## License 
Since this is meant for a course, you must not copy/clone this for any assignments/commercial products. Note: This includes starter code from Udacity. You might want to look at their license as it may be binding for this code too.
